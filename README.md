# Fibonacci
This repository contains a couple of Fibonnaci implementations. One is a naive one which uses recursion, but becomes extremely slow with higher values. Also it contains two fast implementations. One with a loop and the other with recursion.

The goal of this project is to show people that there are multiple ways to solve a problem. Some solutions are better or more elegant than others.
